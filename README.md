# IIUM-Food-Delivery
This is my University Final year project which is build based on PHP(laravel), CSS , javascript and Nodejs.This website in an online 
food delivering website which is used to deliver food inside the campus. It has login and registration option, customer can open their 
profile first. Than can choose order and customize their foods. Students can also choose to work as delivery person as well. In that
case they need to become a member first and sign up as delivery person. Currently there was specific number of shops that 
is listed in the app. This is made to make the lives of students inside campus easier and also to create working opportunities
for the needy students.
